This repository is a collection of technical notes, processes, and observations.
The array of topics is (will be as of Aug 2020) broad and reflects my personal interests.

"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."
-Arther C. Clarke

The name Sylvanomicon is meant to reflect the idea of a grimoire, "spell book", or arcane text,
in the vein of the Necronomicon or Cryptonomicon. "Sylvan" invokes woodlands
or forests, in which I have a strong interest through studying ecology and forest gardening.
Grimoires generally contain spells and incantations, which for
our purposes in the current time manifests as high technology: Software, electronics, hardware, computers.
Oh, and pretty sure I coined the term: When I first googled it, there were 0 results. 

My goal with this work is to collect and document useful information that I have found
or learned in my areas of interest. And who knows, maybe to eventually coalesce
it all into a coherent
philosophy-of-living or manifesto to communicate my world view.

I am influenced by an idea I have had for some time: Rewriting Walden by Thoreau
for modern times from the perspective of a remote software developer
living the pastoral life in a rural area. I left the San Francisco Bay Area in
2014 to go remote full time. I moved to an area with lower prices for property
and significantly less population density so that I could pursue my interests of
growing trees and forest gardening. It was, in many ways, a retreat from the
bustling, busy live of Silicon Valley. Most people I knew thought I was crazy to
leave behind the opportunity and lifestyle available in that large metropolitan area.
In a post-COVID-19 world, I think many others now see the appeal of a simpler life in
a small town. Hence, these writings...

My plan is to publish this work openly and iterate on it over time. Organizing the disparate notes
accumulated through self-study has been on my todo list for too long. During an
employee training workshop I underwent years ago, we were brainstorming ideas.
One of mine that came to mind was, "work in the open". It received
very positive feedback... and yet I have not practiced it to the fullest
extent of my ability. I hope that by working on this repository in the
open it has greater impact than if I simply kept it to myself for years on my
own local hard drive and backups. And that it will be less likely to be lost
to the ages...

I have what I would call an archival mindset. Part of this is living life during
the earlier days of the internet in the mid-90s and seeing things be lost.
Email accounts I had then are no longer accessible to me, and I was too young to
think of backups. File formats become obsolete, software may not be able to run
on very different hardware, etc. This mindset was further bolstered by working
in the scholarly publishing industry. When I started in that industry in Berkeley,
our clients were libraries. One can't help but learn a lot about digital preservation
and archiving while working with modern librarians.

I have chosen git as my writing medium because it is better suited for
the purpose than other, more traditional writing tools. It keeps a log of
changes, versions, and timestamps detailing when revisions were made.
It allows a historical look back at how and when ideas developed.
