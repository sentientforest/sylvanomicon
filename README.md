### The Sylvanomicon

This repository is a collection of technical notes, processes, and observations.
The array of topics is (_...will be_ as of Aug 2020) broad and reflects my personal interests.
But in general, the focus will be on the intersection of high technology and
rural forest living.

The name Sylvanomicon is meant to reflect the idea of a grimoire, "spell book", or arcane text,
in the vein of the Necronomicon or Cryptonomicon. "Sylvan" invokes woodlands
or forests, in which I have a strong interest through studying ecology and forest gardening.
Grimoires generally contain spells and incantations, which for
our purposes in the current time manifests as high technology: Software, electronics, hardware, computers.

My goal with this work is to collect and document useful information that I have found
or learned in my areas of interest. It is a personal knowledge base.

My plan is to publish notes openly and iterate on them over time. Organizing the disparate notes
accumulated through self-study has been on my todo list for too long.

During an employee training workshop I underwent years ago, we were brainstorming ideas.
One of mine that came to mind was, "work in the open". It received
generally positive feedback... and yet I have not practiced it to the fullest
extent of my ability. I hope that by working on this repository in the
open it has greater impact than if I simply kept it to myself for years on my
own local hard drive and backups. And that it will be less likely to be lost
to the ages...

I have chosen git as my writing medium because it is better suited for
the purpose than other, more traditional writing tools. It keeps a log of
changes, versions, and timestamps detailing when revisions were made.
It allows a historical look back at how and when ideas developed.

Eventually, I will add some code and tooling to generate static site(s)
from the content contained herein.
