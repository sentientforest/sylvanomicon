# Plant Notes

The below contains rough notes I have collected over the years. There are links
and citations for various plant species I have considered acquiring and growing.

To put this list in context, the notes are written from the perspective of a
growing in a very hot summer Mediterranean climate. Part of the goal of
collecting these notes is in determining likelihood of whether a useful plant
could succeed in the climate of the Sierra Nevada foothills.

https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/chrchr/all.html
Retrieved 1/25/2018
Native to coast range, area around tahoe
"Giant chinquapin occurs in a wide range of sites from warm, dry,
exposed locations [7,47,78,79,82,116] to low-elevation mesic forests [95,116,139]"
"Although many reports associate giant chinquapin with “xeric” sites
within its distribution, this term and others referring to moisture regime
are often used in a relative sense, making it difficult to compare reports."
"Giant chinquapin occurs in variable soil types [116] but is commonly
associated with rocky [9,10,47,51,76,76,180] and/or
unproductive soils [27,116,124,152]. In forests of southwestern Oregon,
it often indicates rocky sites [9]. The shrub
form commonly occurs on rocky sites [84,86,116]. Within Douglas-fir communities
in southwestern Oregon, giant chinquapin was associated with the
least productive sites [8]."
"The flowers emit a strong musty odor"

http://www.pollenlibrary.com/Specie/Chrysolepis+chrysophylla/
"Allergenicity: No allergy has been reported for Golden Chinkapin
(Chrysolepis chrysophylla) species."
"Honey/Bee Pollen: A plant used as a source of food for Honey Bees,
 and may be a flavor of honey such as clover or alfalfa."

https://www.forestfarm.com/chrysolepis-chrysophylla-chch263
"Spectacular in bloom"

http://www.clovegarden.com/ingred/ok_oaks.html
" In Japan the wood is important as the preferred substrate
for growing shiitake mushrooms. "

http://owic.oregonstate.edu/giant-chinkapin-castanopsis-chrysophylla
" Young giant chinkapins often develop a taproot, while older trees
have a well- developed lateral root system."
"Tolerance, Crown Position
The tree form of giant chinkapin is intermediate in tolerance. Chinkapins
often occur in intermediate canopy positions, although they decline
in vigor and may die after prolonged overtopping by associated conifers
in older stands. Shrub forms of giant chinkapin are quite tolerant of
shade and will persist in the understory."
"Giant chinkapin appears to be most competitive and persistent on droughty,
infertile sites; this is where the oldest trees are usually found.
Young chinkapins are also relatively aggressive
and competitive during early succession on poor sites. "
"Giant chinkapin can grow relatively well on harsh, droughty,
or infertile sites. Good growth and development of chinkapin can
be expected on better sites, but management may be required to
 maintain chinkapin among taller, more competitive associates"
"Judging from its superior competitiveness (relative to associated
tree species) on harsh sites, giant chinkapin appears to have a
high tolerance to extremes of heat, drought, and cold.
 The shrub form becomes more common under extreme climates."
" chinkapin flowers are thought to impart a bad taste to honey."

### jujube

http://www.texasgardener.com/pastissues/janfeb08/Jujube.html
Retrieved 2/10/2018
"The better varieties for fresh use are 'Honey Jar,' 'Sugar Cane,' 'Li,'
'Shanxi Li,' 'Sherwood' and 'Chico' ('GI 7-62'). Of these the largest is
'Shanxi Li' and the smallest is 'Honey Jar.' 'Honey Jar' is the juiciest.
'Chico' ('GI 7-62') matures in mid to late season and 'Sherwood' is the
last of these to ripen in early October. 'Li,' 'Shanxi Li,' 'Honey Jar' and
'Sugar Cane' ripen in August and early September. Also, a 2007 introduction
called 'Winter Delight' is a good variety; at least in China it is
considered a top variety.
The best drying varieties are 'Lang,' 'Li' and 'Shanxi Li.' But any jujube
can be dried. The smaller varieties do not dry well
unless you are very careful and watch them closely so that they do not get
too dry. You want them spongy, not hard as rock, for a good dried jujube."

" Bigtooth maple is drought tolerant [11,14,131,139,149].
Plants require 16 to 20 inches (40-50 cm) of annual precipitation [32,105]. "
"Temperature: Bigtooth maple is cold hardy to at least -31 °F (-35 °C) and
tolerates summer temperatures above 100 °F (38 °C) [11,14,131]."
" Seedlings are shade tolerant and grow under the canopy of mature big
sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) [159] and Gambel oak [26]. "
" In Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, and Idaho, bigtooth maple occurs as a
shade-tolerant, seral understory tree or shrub"
"Syrup can be produced from bigtooth maple sap [12,15,58,63,80,105,149].
Because of its fall coloration and tolerance of alkaline soils,
drought conditions, and cold temperatures, bigtooth maple has
high potential as a landscaping tree
in the western United States [14,105,131,139,149]. "
"Wood Products: Bigtooth maple is a good source of fuelwood [58,63,67,80].
The wood is heavy and hot-burning and regenerates quickly
after cutting [21,76,153]. The wood is used for posts,
and small amounts can be sawed into lumber [63]. "

##### Caper  Capparis spinosa

http://sfp.ucdavis.edu/pubs/brochures/Capers/
Retrieved 2019-12-13

" grows about two feet tall and spreading.
The vines can be 2-3 meters (or 7 to 10 feet long),
and have a very deep root system.
The plant is very drought resistant, needs little cultural care,
requires good drainage, and is practically free of diseases and insect pests."

"The plant is propagated sexually (by seed) or
asexually (by cuttings or roots).
The preferred method is the latter simply because of
the variability found in seed propagated plants."

"spaced 5 X 5 meters (about 16 by 16 feet) apart.
Field planting takes place during February-March.
During the first two summers after planting 2-3 irrigations
are required but plants older than 2 years do not need irrigation.
Spring fertilization with Ammonium sulfate (21-0-0) or 16-16-l6 at a
rate of 1/2 pound per plant per year is advisable.
Watering is required after each application."

"Mature caper plants are pruned to ground level during November-December.
In the spring, tender new shoots develop, which are used as a vegetable and,
according to some people, are better than asparagus spears.
Buds are picked from mid-May to mid-August.
A 2-year old plant will produce some, a 3-year old plant produces
just over 2 lbs/year, and a plant older than 4 years
may produce over 20 lbs. of buds per year.
The unopened buds are picked by hand,
sorted into five different qualities
and brined in a similar way as cucumbers (Figure 4).
The smaller the bud the higher the quality and price.
A glass vial of about 200 grams of good quality caper sells for almost $5.00.
The fruit is also brined but is considered inferior quality,
and is not as important commercially."

 "The wood is light yet has great strength and rot resistance,
 and is particularly highly valued in east Asia,
 with large amounts being exported to Japan where it
 is in high demand for making coffins, and for shrines and temples.[7]
 Its lumber is also known for its highly fragrant ginger aroma.
 Due to the straightness of its grain, it is also one of the
 preferred woods for the manufacture of arrow shafts.
 It is also considered an acceptable, though not ideal, wood for
 construction of aircraft.[8]
However, it is considered more than acceptable for use in stringed instruments.
 Its fine grain, good strength and tonal quality are highly regarded
 for soundboards in guitar making.[9]"

which are often too wet for any other tree, including cottonwood."
" Oregon ash has a fairly high tolerance to summer drought;
however, it generally ceases growth and drops its leaves when conditions become
hot and dry. Oregon ash that establish on drier sites often persist
in a stunted, crooked form."
"Growth of Oregon ash is moderately rapid for the first 60 years
(1 to 2 ft per year). Thereafter, height growth is negligible and top height
is relatively short (60 to 80 ft), although good diameter growth may continue.
Early growth of stump sprouts is quite rapid (3 to 4 ft per year)"

flooring, millwork, pallets, crates, boxes, and firewood."

`Primary Uses:
Ornamental Plant – this has been one of its primary uses around the world
    due to its showy, fragrant flowers and attractive leaves
Nitrogen Fixing Plant – this plant creates its own nitrogen through a
    symbiotic relationship with microorganisms (bacteria) in its roots.
    It typically produces an excess of nitrogen that can be used by
    neighboring plants.
Edible Leaves – Considered a potherb (a plant used as a vegetable or
    as a seasoning). Use when young, before they become fibrous. Aromatic.
    Dried leaves can be used for teas.
Edible Flowers – cooked and eaten as a vegetable.

Secondary Uses:

General insect (especially bees) nectar plant
Butterfly Plant – this plant has nectar that attracts Butterflies
Hummingbird Plant – this plant has nectar that attracts Hummingbirds
Fodder Crop – leaves, pods, and seeds – used for cattle, sheep, and goats
Wildlife Food – many animals will eat the pods and seeds (deer, squirrels, birds, etc.)
Wildlife Shelter – mainly birds and small mammals
Drought Plant – this species can tolerate prolonged dry conditions once established
Windbreak Species – fast growing, but not very tall, also it does not tolerate very high winds
Wood – used for furniture, cabinets, and other building applications
    (a few reports say it is a strong wood, but other say it is a weak wood… with this conflicting information, I would avoid using it for structures)
Fuel Wood – firewood, charcoal
Coppice Plant – while not a traditional coppice plant,
    this plant will grow back from the stump (or stool) and from the roots.
Pioneer Plant – helps reestablish overused or damaged land`
