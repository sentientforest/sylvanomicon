Have a dedicated office with a closed door.
If you have a hollow-core door, replace it with a solid core
door for better soundproofing. Ideally, situate your office in a separate
structure from your main home, which is even better for separating work and
home life.

Use a decent conference phone. Some like headsets. These will give you good
audio quality. I prefer the type of phone
used for meetings with multiple people in conference rooms. I like to know
at a glance when I'm on mute. These types of phones generally have a large
button in the center with red LEDs to indicate when you are muted.

Back when I had a landline I used a Polycom Soundstation. These are
commercial, enterprise grade phones that retail for something like $500 new.
I found one used on eBay for something like $70 years ago. I really enjoyed
the quality the landline provided, but companies like AT&T have been
significantly increasing prices over the years. I imagine it is no longer
profitable for them to maintain the infrastructure for landline phones,
especially in far-flung rural counties such as my own.
With taxes and fees, we were
at one time paying $60 a month to keep our landline. It just wasn't worth it,
given the reliability of my wireless phone. So we canceled the service.

Now, I use a Sennheiser SP 20 conference phone. It has a headphone jack, which
I can plug directly into my work mac mini for audio over the internet. It
works well with Gotomeeting, Slack calls, etc. For connecting to my cell phone
or personal macbook pro, I had to find an adapter on Amazon to connect
the 3.5 mm jack to the lightning / usb-c port.

If you are a full time remote employee, there is no excuse not to either
a) live in a place you love or b) live the digital nomad lifestyle you want.

The digital nomad lifestyle is great for those without strong ties to
family or land. Myself, I'm too interested in growing things, and especially
growing things for the long term, to travel from place to place. But if I were
much younger I would probably go that route for a time just to get an
experience of traveling the world.

Currently, I thoroughly enjoy where I live. I have more land than I could find
in a suburb, and greater distance between myself in my neighbors. Many times
I have found myself on a conference call with colleagues I know to be in a
windowless office in Redwood City or Los Gatos, while I look out the window and
see a hawk fly by or a squirrel dropping cones from a Gray Pine.
