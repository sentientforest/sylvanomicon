## Power Outages and Remote Work

It's Labor Day, September 7th, 2020. Tomorrow is the start of a regular work week,
but here in California PG&E is mandating a Public Safety Power Shutoff (PSPS)
event for parts on the state. This time, mostly the Sierra Foothills are affected.
Tuolumne County looks to be the southermost affected county. Parts of the Coast
Range, such as around Napa, are also impacted.

I'm pretty well prepared. I worked last year throughout various PSPS events,
and didn't miss a single call or meeting. Living in the mountains, we learn to adapt, and not always rely on single points of failure like PG&E. Would you be ready to work if your power was going to be out for two days? I am.

### Requirements for Remote Work

* A powered laptop
* An internet connection
* A powered phone
* A reasonably comfortable environment

#### Laptop Power

* Jackery 240 watt lithium portable generator, with 100 watt solar panel for recharging
* Anker USB C portable power bank (charges a macbook pro slowly, but eventually)
* Vehicle cigarrette lighter 200w inverter

With the solar power, I should in theory be able to power my laptop indefinitely.
On a full charge, I have found the Jackery can keep my laptop at 100% all day under
heavy load (i.e. think of a 6 core, 32 GB memory macbook pro powering multiple
virtual machines all day). The 100 watt panel claims to be able to recharge this
model of lithium generator in about 5 hours. I just got the panel a few weeks
ago and will be testing it over the next few days (Sept 8-9 2020).

Last year, prior to acquiring the Jackery, I had to charge my laptop by idling my
truck in the driveway and converting its car battery energy into ac power for my
laptop charger.

#### Internet

Unlike the major cable provider in our area, my Internet Service Provider (ISP)
keeps the internet on when the power goes out. So as long as I can power my main
network appliances, I will have home internet. And fortunately, these network appliances require little power.

I can power my main home internet router and a wifi access point with a small
Ryobi portable inverter "generator" that runs off their 18v lithium ion batteries.
I generally by DeWalt or Milwaukee tools, so I don't have that many Ryboi tools,
but purchased this small portable generator of theirs specifically for powering my
networking equipment. I have two 6 amp-hour batteries and two 4 ah batteries.
Combined with the UPS (Uniterruptible Power Supply) that these devices are plugged into, I have many hours of power there.

I also recently (as of early Sept 2020) purchased a Protectli Vault with the optional Verizon LTE failover modem. Additionally, Protecli makes their own UPS
specifically for the Vault, and I purhcaseed two. I'm not sure I'll have it setup
tonight for the shutoff happening tomorrow, but we'll see. In theory, this will
give me redunancy on my main internet, such if my ISP goes down I'll automatically
failover to the Verizon LTE modem.

Of course, if all of the above loses power or fails, I can rely on my cell phone to act as a hotspot. As long as it has power, it can give me internet, and Verizon will gleefully bill me for every GB I use over my plans allotment. Hence, the next section...

#### Phone / USB power

To power my phone, ipod touch, old phone, ipad, etc., I have:

* A couple Anker battery banks of varying sizes. These are those portable devices that can easily fit in a bag and recharge devices via USB. Look for them on Black Friday or when they go on sale, and get one or two.
* A DeWalt jobsite radio with usb charging port, that can basically turn my stored DeWalt battery energy into music and phone charge. I think I have ... two 6ah batteries, two 3ah, and two 1.5ah batteries. I could probably charge my phone, ipod, and other usb powered devices dozens of times with this alone.


#### A Reasonably Comfortable Environment

Last year, I bought a Champion 2000 watt portable inverter generator, that runs on either gasoline or propane. It lingered, new in its box, for months until I finally ran it through its break in period today.

* Refrigeration is a useful modern convenience. With my inverter generator, I should be able to keep my food cold. Last year we bought ice and moved food to coolers.
* Ice. PG&E gives fair warning for these outages. One way to keep a refrigerator / freezer cold is to fill it with ice. Ice sells out quickly during these events, but if you have a freezer and tap water you can always make it yourself. Prior to the shutoff, I have filled various small containers (such as empty beer / mineral water cans and small dixie cups) with water and put them in the freezer. My larger freezer even fit two one gallon milk cartons filled 2/3 full with water. Prior the shutoff, I'll put some of these frozen containers in my refrigerator and it will help keep the food cold.
* It's supposedly going to be 99ËšF tomorrow. I have a portable evaporative cooler that I can power with my generator. It won't be nearly as nice as air conditioning, but it's better than nothing. And fortunately our house has a basement which will hopefully stay somewhat cooler due to the thermal properties of the earth on the walls.
