In response to a question asked in the Sonoraville Gardening group:

> Has anyone had positive outcomes with growing Avocado trees in the area? Any tips?
> I’m curious how they do with our winters, but would love to add one to our yard.

I have an avocado tree that has survived the past two winters. It's currently about... 4 ft high and doing great. This past winter it showed little to no frost damage. I planted it in the spring of 2018. Avocados are significantly more frost sensitive in their first few years, while they are small.

You can be successful growing avocados in the foothills, but there are a few important things to consider.

1) The variety. Most named varieties of avocados can not handle cold well. Nurseries don't always list the degrees to which a given variety can survive down to, and sometimes different sources will contradict each other.

By far the most cold hardy avocado I have seen for sale in California is Mexicola. It's rated to survive temperatures down to 18˚F.

There are various other varieties I have seen for sale in California that may be described as "cold-hardy", but nearly all of these can only take cold down to about 26˚F. This includes Bacon, Jim-Bacon, Zutano, Stewart, etc. There are others marketed as cold-hardy but these are the ones I remember of the top of my head.

Seed-grown avocaodos have diverse genetics and could easily be very different from a parent variety, including in the area of cold tolerance. Every pit you plant will be a little different, and some may end up surviving quite well.

Avoid at all costs the following varieties that can't really take temps below 32˚F:  Lamb-Hass, Pinkerton, etc. They're much less likely to survive any kind of cold snap.

Now, be aware, the avocados that survive here may not taste like what you're used to from the store. They vary, but they're still good, and can make great guacamole.

The variety I have is called "Lila". I have never seen it for sale in California. I special ordered it, and another variety called "Fantastic", from Florida. It's very hard to find companies certified to ship certain plants into California, due to our restrictive requirements. There is a company called TopTropicals that is certified. Both of these are rated to survive short temperatures at 10˚F, and 15˚ F for more extended periods. I believe my "Fantastic" variety died either because the frost cloth stuck directly to the tree for some time, causing dew / moisture buildup, or a lack of water in the early early Spring its first year before it was established... sometimes, our rains are spaced out and we get those odd stretches of nice sunny weather earlier than expected and it may have needed a spot of water. It's easy to forget something might need water when it's still cold out and none of your deciduous plants have shown much activity. But it survived its first winter through, all the way until about April or so.

There are in fact many more varieties of cold hardy avocado that have been developed in Texas and Florida (higher elevations) where these types of qualities are more appreciated. Here in California, the bulk of the population is living in areas where an avocado that can only survive down to 26˚F is just fine. And commercial growers in California have different requirements.

I have found a *possible* California source for some cold hardy varieties, but I have yet to see them ever have them in stock. It's called Rolling River Nursery based in Oakland, and they do ship trees. They list some of these varieties on their website but I have not seen them come back in stock in years and have not received notifications from their email alert signup.


2) The specific microclimate of your property, and the specific microclimate of the place on your property where you planted the tree. A cold basin that collects winter air will be colder than an area with exposed rock or a driveway that soaks up daytime sun and radiates it at night. Or a mid-slope location that lets the cold air drain down. An exposed area prone to wind will be more damaging than a sheltered area protected by a wind break.

Haven't tried it, but a container-grown avocado (in a large 30 gallon+ smart pot for example) might do OK and survive cold nights in the microclimate of a garage. Then you could wheel it out after the coldest days have passed to get some sunshine.

3) Extra mitigating factors can make a difference. This can include frost blankets, lights, etc. I have a couple frost blanket / bags that fit over a smallish tree. To see the product, go to groworganic.com, All Categories > Frost & Sun Protection > Frost Blankets to see what I'm talking about. These products claim to offer 6-8˚F of frost protection. That would mean, if you have a Mexicola that can survive to 18˚F, supposedly with one of these it might survive temperatures as low as 10-12˚F.

I would bet that you could find these frost blankets locally at Nature's Whole Food Depot or Solomon's, or they could order them for you if they don't have them in stock. Now, avocado trees do get to be very tall if you let them, and you certainly won't get a frost blanket over a 40' tall tree. At that point they will be somewhat less frost-sensitive, especially as the trunk gets thicker. Or, take a tip from commercial growers: Some commercial growers are now keeping their avocado orchards pruned a maximum of 10' high and wide to facilitate easier harvesting and better yields per acre. At this size or slightly smaller, it would be easier to protect from the cold.

I have found that draping the frost blanket over the wire cylinder I setup to keep deer out works well. This keeps the frost blanket off the tree. Note you'll need a few boards or something across the top to deal with snow load.

If you want to use lights to add a little heat on the coldest nights, look for outdoor *incandescent* lights. These are becoming harder to find because LEDs use less power. But LEDs are very cool (...temperature-wise) and for that very reason won't help save your tree.


4) Remember, surviving the cold is just the first prerequisite... avocados need water, fertilizer, etc. They generally take the same fertilizers as citrus trees. Paint the trunk white on young trees with a solution half water and half regular acrylic paint, because sunburn can damage the trunk before leaves form.

So in sum... it's not impossible. But if Wikipedia can be believed, then the record low for Twain Harte is -1˚F and the record low for Sonora is 8˚F. If you get a night like that... your tree is going to have a bad time. Hasn't stopped me though.

Anecdotally, my uncle who lives south of Yosemite at 3000' knows someone who has grown Mexicola avocados for years at a similar elevation. (I think maybe somewhere in Madera county). From what I've heard, he has many large trees and it sounds like they've been growing for years.
