### Solar and Battery Backup

In California, beginning in 2019, the main electric utility (PG&E) has
begun shutting off power for the Public Safety Power Shutoff program
during high fire-risk weather events.

While working remotely from home over the internet, electrical power and internet
are obviously critical for getting work done.

This file tracks my pricing notes and technical specification research
while considering an install. 

#### Things to know if you don't already

A grid-tied solar system can't power your house when the power goes out.
Unless you have a transfer switch and battery bank.
The transfer switch is necessary to prevent dangerous surges going up the
power lines and endangering workers.

Laws can change, and the price of electricity within a given day/time can
change. Electricity produced by solar when the sun is up is much cheaper
than electricity produced in the evening when usage of the grid is high.

i.e. if you consume power at in the evening for air conditioning, computing,
entertainment etc, you may be buying higher cost power from your utility
compared to the surplus low-cost power you might sell back during the day.

Batteries can offset this by giving you a source to draw on during
high cost periods.

"Two Powerwalls would be needed to power well pumps, medium size HVAC systems,
and heavier loads. Three Tesla Powerwalls would be needed to power
heavier loads at a home like a large HVAC system, a welder, or a
large water pump. "
"The cost for a single Tesla Powerwall cost ranges between $14,000-$16,000.
There is a range of prices because not every home is the same... The cost for
the second one drops considerably. The average price for a two Powerwall system is
around $26,000 (before incentives). It should also be noted that the 26%
federal tax credit applies to the Tesla Powerwall cost."

"lead-acid batteries do not last much longer than lithium ion batteries."
"Efficiency is among the essential metrics to consider when comparing
lead-acid battery vs. lithium ion battery. Depending on the model and
condition, most lead-acid batteries are 80-85 percent efficient, while lithium
batteries are more than 95 percent efficient. Due to the increased efficiency,
it is capable of storing more solar power in the case of lithium batteries."

"Lead-acid batteries are highly likely to overheat when charged quickly. "

"Lead-acid batteries cost less up front, but they have a shorter lifespan and
require regular maintenance to keep them running properly. Lithium batteries
are much more expensive up front, but they are maintenance-free and have a
longer lifespan to match their higher price tag. This article offers a
side-by-side comparison of both options."
